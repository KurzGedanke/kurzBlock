kurzBlock is a persoanl blocklist curated by KurzGedanke. You can use it with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) or any AdBlock you want. 

## Whats on the list

Mostly it is advertising URLs or URLs which are caused by a pop-up, but there is no clear definition what goes on this blocklist, since this is my personal blocklist. It can include services which you may use, but I don't want to be tracked from. 

**Use it at your own risk**

## How do I use it

For example is here a faq to how to add a blocklist to pihole: [How do I add additional block lists to Pi-hole?](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-add-additional-block-lists-to-pi-hole/259)

Most of the time it is fairly easy to add a blocklist to your specific adblock. A short duckduckgo search for "how to add blocklist to $yourAdBlockHere" will do the job. Otherwise feel free to ask, I will look into it! :) 

## I'm on this list

That for sure is sad. I guess it has a reason, why you are on this list, but if you really think it is a mistake, please leave a message or open a issue. I'm happly gonna discuss the situation with you!
